## CRAN Packages

The below packages use extendr and are currently (as of 2025-05-19)
published on CRAN.

| Package | Description | URLs |
|:---|:---|:---|
| arcgisutils | Developer oriented utility functions designed to be used as the building blocks of R packages that work with ArcGIS Location Services. It provides functionality for authorization, Esri JSON construction and parsing, as well as other utilities pertaining to geometry and Esri type conversions. To support ‘ArcGIS Pro’ users, authorization can be done via ‘arcgisbinding’. Installation instructions for ‘arcgisbinding’ can be found at <https://developers.arcgis.com/r-bridge/installation/>. | https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgisutils, https://developers.arcgis.com/r-bridge/api-reference/arcgisutils/ |
| arcpbf | Fast processing of ArcGIS FeatureCollection protocol buffers in R. It is designed to work seamlessly with ‘httr2’ and integrates with ‘sf’. | https://r.esri.com/arcpbf/, https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcpbf |
| b64 | Provides a fast, lightweight, and vectorized base 64 engine to encode and decode character and raw vectors as well as files stored on disk. Common base 64 alphabets are supported out of the box including the standard, URL-safe, bcrypt, crypt, ‘BinHex’, and IMAP-modified UTF-7 alphabets. Custom engines can be created to support unique base 64 encoding and decoding needs. | https://extendr.github.io/b64/, https://github.com/extendr/b64 |
| fcl | A financial calculator that provides very fast implementations of common financial indicators using ‘Rust’ code. It includes functions for bond-related indicators, such as yield to maturity (‘YTM’), modified duration, and Macaulay duration, as well as functions for calculating time-weighted and money-weighted rates of return (using ‘Modified Dietz’ method) for multiple portfolios, given their market values and profit and loss (‘PnL’) data. ‘fcl’ is designed to be efficient and accurate for financial analysis and computation. The methods used in this package are based on the following references: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Dietz_method>, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-weighted_return>. | https://github.com/shrektan/fcl, https://shrektan.github.io/fcl/ |
| fio | Simplifies the process of importing and managing input-output matrices from ‘Microsoft Excel’ into R, and provides a suite of functions for analysis. It leverages the ‘R6’ class for clean, memory-efficient object-oriented programming. Furthermore, all linear algebra computations are implemented in ‘Rust’ to achieve highly optimized performance. | https://albersonmiranda.github.io/fio/, https://github.com/albersonmiranda/fio |
| heck | Provides a case conversion between common cases like CamelCase and snake_case. Using the ‘rust crate heck’ <https://github.com/withoutboats/heck> as the backend for a highly performant case conversion for ‘R’. | https://github.com/DyfanJones/heck, https://dyfanjones.r-universe.dev/heck |
| rsgeo | An R interface to the GeoRust crates ‘geo’ and ‘geo-types’ providing access to geometry primitives and algorithms. | https://github.com/JosiahParry/rsgeo, https://josiahparry.r-universe.dev/rsgeo, https://rsgeo.josiahparry.com/ |
| rshift | Contains a variety of functions, based around regime shift analysis of paleoecological data.

| timeless | Fast general purpose date/time converter using ‘Rust’. The package implements date time, date and epoch time parser for heterogeneous vectors of dates. | https://github.com/schochastics/timeless, https://schochastics.github.io/timeless/ |
| tok | Interfaces with the ‘Hugging Face’ tokenizers library to provide implementations of today’s most used tokenizers such as the ‘Byte-Pair Encoding’ algorithm <https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/index>. It’s extremely fast for both training new vocabularies and tokenizing texts. | https://github.com/mlverse/tok |
| ymd | Convert ‘YMD’ format number or string to Date efficiently, using Rust’s standard library. It also provides helper functions to handle Date, e.g., quick finding the beginning or end of the given period, adding months to Date, etc. | https://shrektan.github.io/ymd/, https://github.com/shrektan/ymd |
| zoomerjoin | Empowers users to fuzzily-merge data frames with millions or tens of millions of rows in minutes with low memory usage. The package uses the locality sensitive hashing algorithms developed by Datar, Immorlica, Indyk and Mirrokni (2004) <doi:10.1145/997817.997857>, and Broder (1998) <doi:10.1109/SEQUEN.1997.666900> to avoid having to compare every pair of records in each dataset, resulting in fuzzy-merges that finish in linear time. | https://beniamino.org/zoomerjoin/, https://github.com/beniaminogreen/zoomerjoin |
