| Package | Description | URL |
|:---|:---|:---|
| arcgis | Provides easy installation and loading of core ArcGIS location services packages ‘arcgislayers’, ‘arcgisutils’, ‘arcgisgeocode’, and ‘arcgisplaces’. Enabling developers to interact with spatial data and services from ‘ArcGIS Online’, ‘ArcGIS Enterprise’, and ‘ArcGIS Platform’. Learn more about the ‘arcgis’ meta-package at <https://developers.arcgis.com/r-bridge/>. | https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgis/, https://developers.arcgis.com/r-bridge/ |
| arcgisgeocode | A very fast and robust interface to ArcGIS ‘Geocoding Services’. Provides capabilities for reverse geocoding, finding address candidates, character-by-character search autosuggestion, and batch geocoding. The public ‘ArcGIS World Geocoder’ is accessible for free use via ‘arcgisgeocode’ for all services except batch geocoding. ‘arcgisgeocode’ also integrates with ‘arcgisutils’ to provide access to custom locators or private ‘ArcGIS World Geocoder’ hosted on ‘ArcGIS Enterprise’. Learn more in the ‘Geocode service’ API reference <https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/api-reference/overview-world-geocoding-service.htm>. | https://github.com/r-arcgis/arcgisgeocode, https://developers.arcgis.com/r-bridge/api-reference/arcgisgeocode |
| arcgisplaces | The ArcGIS ‘Places service’ is a ready-to-use location service that can search for businesses and geographic locations around the world. It allows you to find, locate, and discover detailed information about each place. Query for places near a point, within a bounding box, filter based on categories, or provide search text. ‘arcgisplaces’ integrates with ‘sf’ for out of the box compatibility with other spatial libraries. Learn more in the ‘Places service’ API reference <https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/places/>. | NA |
| arcgisutils | Developer oriented utility functions designed to be used as the building blocks of R packages that work with ArcGIS Location Services. It provides functionality for authorization, Esri JSON construction and parsing, as well as other utilities pertaining to geometry and Esri type conversions. To support ‘ArcGIS Pro’ users, authorization can be done via ‘arcgisbinding’. Installation instructions for ‘arcgisbinding’ can be found at <https://developers.arcgis.com/r-bridge/installation/>. | https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgisutils, https://developers.arcgis.com/r-bridge/api-reference/arcgisutils/ |
| arcpbf | Fast processing of ArcGIS FeatureCollection protocol buffers in R. It is designed to work seamlessly with ‘httr2’ and integrates with ‘sf’. | https://r.esri.com/arcpbf/, https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcpbf |
| awdb | Query the four endpoints of the ‘Air and Water Database (AWDB) REST API’ maintained by the National Water and Climate Center (NWCC) at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Endpoints include data, forecast, reference-data, and metadata. The package is extremely light weight, with ‘Rust’ via ‘extendr’ doing most of the heavy lifting to deserialize and flatten deeply nested ‘JSON’ responses. The AWDB can be found at <https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/awdbRestApi/swagger-ui/index.html>. | https://github.com/kbvernon/awdb, https://kbvernon.github.io/awdb/ |
| b64 | Provides a fast, lightweight, and vectorized base 64 engine to encode and decode character and raw vectors as well as files stored on disk. Common base 64 alphabets are supported out of the box including the standard, URL-safe, bcrypt, crypt, ‘BinHex’, and IMAP-modified UTF-7 alphabets. Custom engines can be created to support unique base 64 encoding and decoding needs. | https://extendr.github.io/b64/, https://github.com/extendr/b64 |
| fcl | A financial calculator that provides very fast implementations of common financial indicators using ‘Rust’ code. It includes functions for bond-related indicators, such as yield to maturity (‘YTM’), modified duration, and Macaulay duration, as well as functions for calculating time-weighted and money-weighted rates of return (using ‘Modified Dietz’ method) for multiple portfolios, given their market values and profit and loss (‘PnL’) data. ‘fcl’ is designed to be efficient and accurate for financial analysis and computation. The methods used in this package are based on the following references: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Dietz_method>, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-weighted_return>. | https://github.com/shrektan/fcl, https://shrektan.github.io/fcl/ |
| fio | Simplifies the process of importing and managing input-output matrices from ‘Microsoft Excel’ into R, and provides a suite of functions for analysis. It leverages the ‘R6’ class for clean, memory-efficient object-oriented programming. Furthermore, all linear algebra computations are implemented in ‘Rust’ to achieve highly optimized performance. | https://albersonmiranda.github.io/fio/, https://github.com/albersonmiranda/fio |
| heck | Provides a case conversion between common cases like CamelCase and snake_case. Using the ‘rust crate heck’ <https://github.com/withoutboats/heck> as the backend for a highly performant case conversion for ‘R’. | https://github.com/DyfanJones/heck, https://dyfanjones.r-universe.dev/heck |
| orbweaver | Seamlessly build and manipulate graph structures, leveraging its high-performance methods for filtering, joining, and mutating data. Ensures that mutations and changes to the graph are performed in place, streamlining your workflow for optimal productivity. | https://github.com/ixpantia/orbweaver-r |
| rbm25 | BM25 is a ranking function used by search engines to rank matching documents according to their relevance to a user’s search query. This package provides a light wrapper around the ‘BM25’ ‘rust’ crate for Okapi BM25 text search. For more information, see Robertson et al. (1994) <https://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec3/t3_proceedings.html>. | https://davzim.github.io/rbm25/, https://github.com/DavZim/rbm25/ |
| rshift | Contains a variety of functions, based around regime shift analysis of paleoecological data.

| rtiktoken | A thin wrapper around the tiktoken-rs crate, allowing to encode text into Byte-Pair-Encoding (BPE) tokens and decode tokens back to text. This is useful to understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) perceive text. | https://davzim.github.io/rtiktoken/, https://github.com/DavZim/rtiktoken/ |
| SQLFormatteR | A convenient interface for formatting ‘SQL’ queries directly within ‘R’. It acts as a wrapper around the ‘sql_format’ Rust crate. The package allows you to format ‘SQL’ code with customizable options, including indentation, case formatting, and more, ensuring your ‘SQL’ queries are clean, readable, and consistent. | https://dataupsurge.github.io/SQLFormatteR/, https://github.com/dataupsurge/SQLFormatteR |
| tergo | Provides a set of functions that allow users for styling their R code according to the ‘tidyverse’ style guide. The package uses a native Rust implementation to ensure the highest performance. Learn more about ‘tergo’ at <https://rtergo.pagacz.io>. | https://rtergo.pagacz.io, https://github.com/kpagacz/tergo |
| tomledit | A toolkit for working with ‘TOML’ files in R while preserving formatting, comments, and structure. ‘tomledit’ enables serialization of R objects such as lists, data.frames, numeric, logical, and date vectors. | https://extendr.github.io/tomledit/, https://github.com/extendr/tomledit |
| xactonomial | We consider the problem where we observe k vectors (possibly of different lengths), each representing an independent multinomial random vector. For a given function that takes in the concatenated vector of multinomial probabilities and outputs a real number, this is a Monte Carlo estimation procedure of an exact p-value and confidence interval. The resulting inference is valid even in small samples, when the parameter is on the boundary, and when the function is not differentiable at the parameter value, all situations where asymptotic methods and the bootstrap would fail. For more details see Sachs, Fay, and Gabriel (2025) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2406.19141>. | https://sachsmc.github.io/xactonomial/ |
| ymd | Convert ‘YMD’ format number or string to Date efficiently, using Rust’s standard library. It also provides helper functions to handle Date, e.g., quick finding the beginning or end of the given period, adding months to Date, etc. | https://shrektan.github.io/ymd/, https://github.com/shrektan/ymd |
| zoomerjoin | Empowers users to fuzzily-merge data frames with millions or tens of millions of rows in minutes with low memory usage. The package uses the locality sensitive hashing algorithms developed by Datar, Immorlica, Indyk and Mirrokni (2004) <doi:10.1145/997817.997857>, and Broder (1998) <doi:10.1109/SEQUEN.1997.666900> to avoid having to compare every pair of records in each dataset, resulting in fuzzy-merges that finish in linear time. | https://beniamino.org/zoomerjoin/, https://github.com/beniaminogreen/zoomerjoin |
